# Selenium WebDriver TestNG Framework

This repository contains a basic TestNG framework for Selenium WebDriver, designed for web automation testing. The framework is structured to demonstrate essential features like parameterization, data-driven testing, and logging.

## Features

- **Parameterization:** Use TestNG's `@Parameters` annotation to run the same test with different sets of data.

- **Data-Driven Testing:** Leverage TestNG's `@DataProvider` to perform data-driven testing with various input values.

- **Logging:** Implement logging using Log4j to capture and analyze test execution details.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- ChromeDriver (or other WebDriver executable)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-testng-framework.git
